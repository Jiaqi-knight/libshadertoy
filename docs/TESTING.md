# Testing

Semi-automated tests are included in order to check the library is functioning
correctly. They can be run using the helper script `test.sh`.

```bash
# Test the library on example 10-gradient
#  This will compile the library, install it to build/install/usr/local, compile
#  the example and run it
./test.sh debian/tests/10-gradient
```
